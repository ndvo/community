### Fork


This fork aims to provide a quick Brazilian portuguese translation of Documize while the official multilanguage support is not provided.


This effort is being done as part of an evaluation to choose the best suite to be used within SPU, a Brazilian public organization.

***


Documize is an open source modern, lightweight and comprehensive alternative to Confluence.

It's built with Golang + EmberJS and compiled down to a single executable binary for Linux, Windows and macOS.

All you need to provide is PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server or any MySQL variant.

- Built for technical and non-technical users
- Designed to unify both customer-facing and internal documentation
- Organization through labels, spaces and categories
- No fee-charging marketplace
